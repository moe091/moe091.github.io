                                This Android app was created as a freelance job in 2013 for a client who hired me through elance.com(now upwork.com). My job was to make a simple android app to go along with a recently published book that contained rules, guides, and other information on 100 different card/dice/dart/domino games. The app had to include all the information in the book, which the client provided me in the form of 100 html-formatted documents. I found a way to easily display his html files within the app, and also added a scoreboard feature that allowed app users to keep score in various different games. The client was very pleased with my work, leaving this feedback after I finished his app:

The game uses hardware acceleration on any device capable of it, but falls back on software rendering to function on older devices. The gameplay is pretty simple but has an addictive element to it once you get going.

                                Before this project I already had experience with javascript, but this was my first time using the language for a larger and performance-critical application. I used performance profiling tools and some simple but effective tricks to get the game to run at a decent framerate even on older hardware without hardware-acceleration from a gpu and find + get rid of any memory leaks in my javascript. I learned how to architect a clean and understandable code structure with javascripts tricky prototypal-OOP, and how to apply the performance-conscious coding skills I learned from my earlier Java and C++ projects in javascript.

                                Gulp is a mobile-browser game made in HTML5 back when mobile browsers first started supporting HTML5 and hardware acceleration via WebGL. I was excited about HTML5 and already had a lot of experience with game development, so naturally I dove right into HTML5 game development. This game was my learning project for HTML5, and I also gained a much better understanding of the workings of javascript, and specifically its prototypal OOP, while making it. Getting the game working was easy, the main challenge was optimizing it to the point where it would run at a decent framerate on mobile devices; at the time this game was made realtime mobile-browser games were extremely simple due to performance restrictions. The game will render using WebGL to take advantage of hardware-acceleration on compatible devices, but falls back on software rendering on devices that aren't compatible with WebGL. This version of the game has all the core gameplay intact but details such as instructions and a scoreboard are unpolished. A couple other very similar versions of the game were made to accomodate mobile web game portal websites who bought licenses to host this game on their site - similar to flash games in the early days of the flash game portals, even the simplest mobile HTML5 games sold for a decent price back when I made this.

                                This game is another Android app created for a client when I was freelancing. The gameplay is simple, it involves placing weights on a balance to try and even it out by getting the fractions on the weights on each side of the scale to add up to the same amount. The physics in the game are real, instead of simply using animations to make the balance tip to whichever side had more weight, it is created from several pieces, connected at a pivot, and the simulated mass of each of the weights is actually equal to the fraction written on it. The physics simulation is powered by Box2D, which gives the game a more realistic feel and provides intuitive feedback for the player.

                                    "We are glad to work with him. We are really satisfied with his work and his report."

                                This website was a freebie I created for a friend who was starting a home cleaning business. I wanted to practice my web design skills and was just looking for an excuse to create a website, which is why I went along and finished the design even though the friend I was making it for found another job and was no longer cleaning homes. The site uses very clean and organized HTML, CSS, and javascript, to create an effective and aesthetically pleasing design with as simple and readable of a codebase as possible. The site has a few different page designs, all following the same style, to accomodate different pages the site would've required. The actual content is still just Lorem Ipsum text but visually and technically the website is complete. Before this I usually didn't design websites myself, someone else would create the design in photoshop and I'd just convert it into html/css/js. Adding design skills to my skillset was great because it really synergized with my backend and frontend development skills, allowing me to create almost any kind of website from scratch, totally on my own.
