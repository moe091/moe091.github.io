            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Phaser is one of the biggest open-source HTML5 Game Development Frameworks out right now. Late in 2014 I was hired by Photonstorm to create a set of ~50 examples of their new commercial Box2D plugin for Phaser for users of the plugin to use as reference. The examples ranged from as simple as creating a physical body and adding it to the world to as complex as creating a fully functioning 2d truck that the user could control inside a realistic physics simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ended up creating a little under 50 seperate examples, ranging from a couple dozen lines of code to a couple hundred each. Unfortunately, Phaser and the Box2D plugin have been updated since then, along with all of the examples I created. I don't have any backups of the original code I created but at least the content of the examples has remained almost exactly the same, the only changes I noted where the addition of the Pinball game example and the removal of my amazing Theo Jansen Walker(<a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/c1/de/d0/c1ded0f9a40dd41afab505ccaec69af4.gif">Here</a> is an example if you don't know what a Theo Jansen Walker is) and some other simple but redundant examples.
            </p>
            <p>The project involved using Phaser along with the almost-finished Box2D physics plugin to write code that would be displayed on the examples page of the phaser website. Each example would have it's own page that displayed the code itself(complete with comments designed to help users using it as a reference) alongside the actual example for the user to play with. The main challenge I faced in this project was learning and using the Box2D plugin with little documentation and no other learning resources, I had never needed to learn to use new tech without the help of documentation or any kind of guides/tutorials at that point, and this forced me to learn how to dive into a codebase and search and explore in order to find out how it worked and how to make it do what I wanted it to. Luckily I had experience with the Phaser framework as well as using Box2D on other platforms(mostly Java), so although it was difficult at first I ultimately succeeded and increased my confidence as a developer.</p>
            
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <h4><b>Tech Used: </b>Javascript, HTML5, Phaser, Box2D</h4>
            <p>
                I wrote all of the code in Javascript using Phaser - a HTML5 game development framework, along with the Box2D plugin - a javascript port of the popular Box2D physics library.
            </p>
            <p>
                Phaser is a javascript game development framework that uses HTML5 Canvas and WebGL to provide hardware accelerated graphics on desktop and mobile devices. It can also be confiugred to use software rendering, allowing it to run on devices that don't support hardware acceleration. It also provides common features and functionality for game development such as input handling, collision detection, sound, and physics.

            <h2>Personal Notes</h2>
            <p>
                This was the most fun freelance job I've ever worked on. Aside from getting to play around with a physics simulator the whole time, I really enjoyed the challenge of learning to use a new library with my only resource being the code itself. I got a great sense of satisfaction whenever I figured out how to make something work, and my confidence grew alongside my comprehension of the codebase itself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent a lot of time messing around and making neat little 'toys' with Box2D during the course of this project. I definitely should have spent more time finishing the actual job and waited until it was complete to play around, I originally estimated the project would take 2 weeks but in the end it was closer to 3. Luckily my client didn't seem to mind and I was able to learn my lesson without having to suffer any serious consequences. The final result was exactly what my client wanted and he seemed pretty happy with my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I consider this project to be a milestone for me as a developer. I gained a lot of confidence and competence while working on it and it was probably the first time I felt like a real software developer. I can't wait until I have enough free time to play around with Phaser and Box2D again and make something much greater with it now that my skills have improved considerably.
