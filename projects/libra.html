            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    This game was made to help young students learn fractions in a fun and intuitive way. The game consists of a balance, with one or more weights already placed on the right side weighing it down. Each weight is labeled with a fraction such as "1/4" that signifies that it weights 1/4th of a pound. At the bottom of the screen are a selection of other weights, each one also labeled with a fraction to show how much they weigh. The player can 'pick up' the weights on the bottom by touching and dragging them wherever they want before letting go and dropping it to try and land it on the left side of the balance. The goal is to place the right combination of weights on the left side of the balance so their weight matches the total weight of the right side of the balance, causing the scale to even out. Once it evens out and the balance levels out they win and move on to the next round.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The physics system is extremely realistic and accurate. It's not just coded to tilt the balance to whichever side has more weight like the previous version I was hired to rewrite, it's a real balance with a pivot point in the middle and a baskets of equal weight hanging from each side. The weights model real objects, each one simulated with a mass equal to the fraction that labels it. inertia is taken into account and gravity is modeled at 9.8(scale) meters per second squared. When a heavy weight is dropped from a high height it will quickly rotate the balance and then slowly tilt back and forth until it evens out based on the physical laws it's programmed to obey. The physics engine updates 30 times each second, the same rate at which the frames are rendered. The end product is very smooth, realistic, and accurate physics simulation. I put in a lot of work to get every detail just right because I was enthusiastic about the project, but Box2D did most of the heavy lifting for me math-wise.

            <h2>Technology and Features</h2>
                <h4><b>Tech used: </b>Java, AndEngine(OpenGL), Box2D</h4>
                <p>
                    This was a heavily physics-based game. Box2D is a great engine and can simulate individual objects exactly how you set it up to. This project required combining many different individual objects in different arrangements to create mroe complex objects and get a perfect realistic simulation. The "Libra"(balance/scale shown in the screenshot) itself consists of a static(solid but unable to move) beam that acted as the center support beam for the balance and a dynamic(solid and moving according to the laws of physics) pole. The pole was attached to the top of the beam with an anchor at its exact center, permanantly connecting the pole to the beam but allowing the pole to rotate with the anchor as its axis of rotation. Each end of the pole had a basket hanging from it. Each basket was connected to 2 ropes, one on each side to keep the basket from tipping over if a weight was placed too far to either side of it. Each side of the top pole had an anchor point to which the other ends of the ropes were attached, allowing the baskets to hang, suspended from opposite ends of the pole. When a weight was dropped onto one of the baskets the weight would pull down on that side of the pole causing the balance to tilt. The baskets themselves would even swing back and forth a little bit sometimes from the force of the weight landing on it. The rest of the development was mostly basic, just setting up the touch controls and 'turning off' the physics for the weights when the user is dragging them, as well as some simple methods to check when the user has one and creating random but challenging levels by choosing the fractional masses for the starting weights on the right side of the scale and at the bottom while making sure there is at least one combination available to solve each level.

                    The client was happy with the realistic and detailed simulation of the new version of the game I created. The previous one didn't rely on real physics, and the balance was just programmed to tilt at a certain angle depending on the ratio of the weights on the left and right sides, which is exactly what she wanted.

            <h2>Personal Notes</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was very fun to create and I found that I genuinely enjoyed creating a game for kids that makes them think and helps them learn. I always love working with Box2D too, physics has been an interest of mine since I was in middle school and I've created many basic physics simulators on my own but nothing that compares to Box2D. For some reason I'm fascinated with physics engines and simulations, it's like creating a virtual world where you can control everything and make it do whatever you want. In terms of the technical aspects and the project itself, this might have been the most fun piece of software I have ever been paid to create.
