            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                White Glove Cleaning is a website I made as a pro-bono job for a previous clients friend. I was considering adding web design and development to my freelance repertoire and thought this would be a good opportunity to add a website to my portfolio and help me get started with freelance web development. The client had just been laid off from her day job, and wanted to expand her home cleaning side-business so she could make up for the loss of income so I offered to make a basic website for free if she promised to recommend me to her friends and family.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made a simple, but clean and professional looking website that I felt had an appropriate aesthetic for a cleaning business. The website is fully responsive and neatly designed. I also created a a custom logo for her business for use on the website and any flyers/business cards she might create(unfortunately, back then my graphic design skills weren't quite as good as they are now). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Part-way through the project she informed me that she had found a new job, and wouldn't require a website to acquire new clients, as her new day job and her current clients were enough to fill up her schedule. I decided to finish the project anyway, as my main goal was to brush up on my web development skills and create a professional website for my portfolio. The project you see here is the finished product, with all the would-be content replaced by filler text. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <h4><b>Tech Used: </b> HTML5, CSS3, JS, JQuery, Photoshop</h4>
            <p>
                This project was a pretty straight-forward and simple website. It didn't need a backend and the only some basic Javascript
                for the image slideshow, and for that I only modified the premade slider code I found online(although I have since made many similar and more complex implementations on my own since then).
            </p>
            <p>
                This was my first fully-responsive complete website I made without using a framework such as bootstrap. I wanted to learn and understand the innerworkings of a grid system so I made a custom one with the help of a few online tutorials. I learned a lot about writing organized and clean css, the internals of grid systems and responsive design, and got some practice with web design while creating this project.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Personal Notes</h2>
            <p>
                Although the client ended up having no use for a website, I'm glad I got this opportunity to create a professional website for a real client. She left most of the decisions to me and I had to consider many things about making a real website with a specific purpose that I never had to think about before. The experience was invaluable for getting me back into web development and I have since improved my skills greatly, it lead me onto the path to become a web developer and I have since greatly improved my skills in that area. Years later, I now consider frontend and backend web development to be one of my specialties, on par with mobile and game development
