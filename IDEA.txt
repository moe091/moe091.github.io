html tool idea:
create html "modules" which are seperate files containing html content, but with certain parts replaced by variables.

goals: modularity, reduction of repeated code(in development code), simplicity, efficiency.

all required variables must be declared at top of document
non-required variables can optionally be declared
variables can be given a default value when declared

in your real html files, include a declaration for the module with a reference to its file name/location, followed by values for all the
variables. variables that aren't given a value and don't have a default value will be left blank. 'required' variables that aren't given a
value will throw a script when you try to compile the html. 


this can be used on commonly repeated groups of html elements, such as listing products with image/description/price/name on an ecommerce 
site. variables will often be used for the content, but it would be possible to use them for html elements themselves if you had a reason to.
