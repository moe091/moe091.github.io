           Gulp is a mobile-browser game made in HTML5 back when mobile browsers first started supporting HTML5 and hardware acceleration via WebGL. I was excited about HTML5 and already had a lot of experience with game development, so naturally I dove right into HTML5 game development. This game was my learning project for HTML5, and I also gained a much better understanding of the workings of javascript, and specifically its prototypal OOP, while making it. Getting the game working was easy, the main challenge was optimizing it to the point where it would run at a decent framerate on mobile devices; at the time this game was made realtime mobile-browser games were extremely simple due to performance restrictions. The game will render using WebGL to take advantage of hardware-acceleration on compatible devices, but falls back on software rendering on devices that aren't compatible with WebGL. This version of the game has all the core gameplay intact but details such as instructions and a scoreboard are unpolished. A couple other very similar versions of the game were made to accomodate mobile web game portal websites who bought licenses to host this game on their site - similar to flash games in the early days of the flash game portals, even the simplest mobile HTML5 games sold for a decent price back when I made this.

<h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                                
                                This is a game I made in HTML5, it works on both mobile and desktop web browsers and was created when mobile web browsers first started supporting HTML5/hardware acceleration in web browsers. The game uses hardware acceleration on any device capable of it, but falls back on software rendering to function on older devices. The gameplay is pretty simple but has an addictive element to it once you get going.

            <h2>How it was made</h2>
            <p>
                                
                                This game was created using javascript and the Phaser library for graphics. Before this project I already had experience with javascript, but this was my first time using the language for a larger and performance-critical application. I used performance profiling tools and a few different techniques to get the game to run at a decent framerate even on older hardware without hardware-acceleration from a gpu and find + get rid of any memory leaks in my javascript. I focused on architecting a clean and understandable code structure with javascripts tricky prototypal-OOP, and applying the performance-conscious coding skills I learned from my earlier Java and C++ projects in javascript.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What I did/what I learned</h2>
            <p>
                I created everything on this project. The only code that wasn't written by me was the Phaser library I used for graphics(although I actually did <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/category/box2d">contribute</a> to phaser later on). This was the original project that got my feet wet with serious javascript coding, beyond just making slideshows/carousels for websites and using basic jquery functions. The development of this game took me from understanding the syntax of javascript, to understanding the language itself and having a deep grasp of its inner-workings and its strengths and weaknesses, which give me the insight to understand the most efficient and effective way to craft javascript code and use it to impose my will onto webpages.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                    I even created all the graphics, except for the background texture, myself. I used to always leave the graphical aspect of my creations to someone else because I thought I had no talent for it, but this was the first project where I decided to take a shot at it myself and work on developing my graphics/design skills. Although the graphics aren't <i>horrible</i>, they completely lack any kind of style, and my design skills have come a long way since then.
