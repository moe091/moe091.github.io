            This Android app was created as a freelance job in 2013 for a client who hired me through elance.com(now upwork.com). My job was to make a simple android app to go along with a recently published book that contained rules, guides, and other information on 100 different card/dice/dart/domino games. The app had to include all the information in the book, which the client provided me in the form of 100 html-formatted documents. I found a way to easily display his html files within the app, and also added a scoreboard feature that allowed app users to keep score in various different games. The client was very pleased with my work, leaving this feedback after I finished his app: 
                                <br> 
                                <br>
                                "Superb work! Very responsive, extensive subject matter knowledge, exacting attention to detail, and results exactly as represented. Would not hesitate to hire again!" 
                                <br>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was created as a freelance job, I was learning Android development at the time, and one of my favorite and quickest ways to learn a new platform or language is to take a freelance job that requires it and just dig in, this job looked relatively simple so I figured it'd be perfect.<br>
                    <br>
                    I was hired to create an app based on a guidebook written by the client, he provided me with a few images for ui elements and documents containing the contents of the book(instructions and other info on various card/dice/darts/domino games) marked up with HTML to format them. My job was to to put it together into an app. I had to create the UI, create a page for a scoreboard, built to the clients specifications, and I had to find a way to parse and display the many html files provided by the client. Development was smooth and painless, and the client was very satisfied with the final product, leaving this feedback on Elance.com: <br>

            <p>
                    I was both proud and surprised that my client got the impression that I had "extensive subject-matter knowledge," considering this was my first non-game Android project. I think "impressive google skills" would have been more accurate, but I guess they both look similar from a clients perspective in this case.
            </p>
            
                                
            <h2>How it was made</h2>
            <p>
                                
                                This project was pretty straightforward, the client provided me with a description of his requirements and I just used the android SDK and default Android libraries to follow his guidelines. The scoreboard required some slight planning to make it work with 1-8 players and any possible number of rounds which the user can create, edit, and delete at any time. 
                                
                                </p>
            
            <p>
                The only techinically-involved aspect of creating this app was finding a way to quickly display the HTML documents containing the main content of the app. The first and most simple method I tried was to just create a WebView and load the html file into it. It would've been great if this worked, but a common quirk in the current(at the time) Android version caused the webview to take several seconds to load, many other people had the same issue and StackOverflow responses to posts about the issue suggested only alternatives to using a webview or hacks to hide/disguise the long load time from users. It was a long time ago, but I believe I got around the issue by using some 3rd party library to parse the html.
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>What I did/what I learned</h2>
            <p>
                As this project was a freelance job, my role was to simply convert the clients specifications into working and efficient code, the client provided all images/graphics.
                </p>
            <p>
                Through creating this app, I learned all the fundamentals of creating an Android app, from scratch to testing on all screen sizes/device types/Android OS versions, to creating a .apk and deploying it to Google Play and Amazon App Store.
